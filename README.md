# Danny's Diner Data Analysis

Danny seriously loves Japanese food, so in the beginning of 2021, he decided to embark upon a risky venture and opened up a cute little restaurant that sells his three favorite foods: sushi, curry, and ramen.

## Problem Statement

Danny’s Diner needs assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat. The restaurant has captured some basic data from their few months of operation but has no idea how to use this data to help run the business.

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent, and which menu items are their favorites. Having these insights will help him deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers.

He plans to use these insights to help decide whether to expand the existing customer loyalty program. Additionally, he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided three key datasets for this case study:

- `sales`
- `menu`
- `members`


#### Table 1: sales
The sales table captures all **customer_id** level purchases with an corresponding **order_date** and **product_id** information for when and what menu items were ordered.

#### Table 2: menu
The menu table maps the **product_id** to the actual **product_name** and price of each menu item.

#### Table 3: members
The final members table captures the **join_date** when a **customer_id** joined the beta version of the Danny’s Diner loyalty program.
